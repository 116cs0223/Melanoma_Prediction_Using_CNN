#  Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Here we have to create a CNN model for the probelem statement.
- Melanoma cancer is one of the preominant skin cancer types that accounts for maximum death.
- If it is detected or suspected at early stages, it can reduce a lot of work and dermatologists can start dignosis.
The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and come up with a CNN model to predict the cancer on basis of the image of the skin spot.

- The privide dataset has images of 9 different types of cancer like 
1. Actinic keratosis  
2. Basal cell carcinoma  
3. Dermatofibroma  
4. Melanoma  
5. Nevus  
6. Pigmented benign keratosis  
7. Seborrheic keratosis  
8. Squamous cell carcinoma  
9. Vascular lesion

## Conclusions

- Neuran network like CNN can predict these cancers with upto 72% accuracy.
